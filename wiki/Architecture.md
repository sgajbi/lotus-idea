# Architecture

`lotus-idea` is a separate domain service because opportunity intelligence spans
portfolio facts, performance, risk, advisory, management, reporting, AI, gateway,
and Workbench concerns.

## Source Authority

`lotus-idea` consumes official evidence and carries provenance. It does not
recompute official calculations.

| Domain | Source owner |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio, holdings, cash, mandate, client, product facts | `lotus-core` |
| Performance and attribution | `lotus-performance` |
| Risk, concentration, volatility, stress, scenarios | `lotus-risk` |
| Proposals, suitability, advisory journey | `lotus-advise` |
| Model portfolios, rebalance, DPM actions | `lotus-manage` |
| AI workflows and model/provider execution | `lotus-ai` |
| Report packages | `lotus-report` |
| Rendering | `lotus-render` |
| Archive, retention, legal hold | `lotus-archive` |
| Product composition | `lotus-gateway` |
| User experience | `lotus-workbench` |

## Data Mesh Baseline

Repo-owned proposed mesh declarations live under `contracts/`:

1. `contracts/domain-data-products/lotus-idea-products.v1.json`
2. `contracts/domain-data-products/lotus-idea-consumers.v1.json`
3. `contracts/domain-data-products/mesh-readiness.v1.json`
4. `contracts/trust-telemetry/idea-candidate.telemetry.v1.json`
5. `contracts/mesh-slo/`
6. `contracts/mesh-access/`
7. `contracts/mesh-evidence/`

Certification is not claimed. Products stay `proposed` and the current static
telemetry is blocked until runtime implementation and platform mesh validation
exist.

## Architecture Decisions

ADRs live in `docs/architecture/adr/`:

1. `ADR-0001-lotus-idea-service-boundary.md`
2. `ADR-0002-scaffold-and-repository-foundation.md`
3. `ADR-0003-source-authority-and-data-mesh-boundaries.md`
4. `ADR-0004-ai-assisted-human-governed-decision-support.md`
