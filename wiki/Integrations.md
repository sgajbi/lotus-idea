# Integrations

`lotus-idea` is an orchestrating domain service. It must integrate through
source-owned APIs, data products, and Gateway/BFF contracts.

## Upstream

1. `lotus-core`
2. `lotus-performance`
3. `lotus-risk`
4. `lotus-advise`
5. `lotus-manage`
6. `lotus-report`
7. `lotus-ai`

## Downstream

1. `lotus-gateway`
2. `lotus-workbench`
3. `lotus-advise`
4. `lotus-manage`
5. `lotus-report`
6. `lotus-render`
7. `lotus-archive`

Integration claims are planned until the relevant RFC-0002 slice is implemented
and certified.

## Data Product Dependencies

Mesh integration truth starts in
`contracts/domain-data-products/lotus-idea-consumers.v1.json`.
`make data-mesh-contract-gate` keeps this declaration aligned with the current
source-authority posture and optionally reconciles it with the sibling
`lotus-platform` generated product catalog when that checkout is present.

The current planned consumer declaration names source-authority products for
the RFC-0002 first-wave map:

1. `lotus-core:PortfolioStateSnapshot:v1`
2. `lotus-core:HoldingsAsOf:v1`
3. `lotus-core:PortfolioCashMovementSummary:v1`
4. `lotus-core:PortfolioCashflowProjection:v1`
5. `lotus-core:BenchmarkAssignment:v1`
6. `lotus-performance:ReturnsSeriesBundle:v1`
7. `lotus-performance:BenchmarkExposureContext:v1`
8. `lotus-performance:MandatePerformanceHealthContext:v1`
9. `lotus-risk:RiskMetricsReport:v1`
10. `lotus-risk:MandateRiskHealthContext:v1`
11. `lotus-risk:RegimeScenarioPackEvaluation:v1`
12. `lotus-advise:AdvisoryProposalLifecycleRecord:v1`
13. `lotus-advise:AdvisoryPolicyEvaluationRecord:v1`
14. `lotus-advise:AdvisoryCopilotInteractionRecord:v1`
15. `lotus-manage:PortfolioActionRegister:v1`
16. `lotus-report:ClientReportEvidencePack:v1`

`lotus-idea` planned producer products remain proposed until implementation and
platform certification.

## Current Source Adapter Posture

RFC-0002 Slice 05 now defines the first Core source-port foundation for
high-cash / idle-liquidity evidence. The application can orchestrate through a
`CoreOpportunitySourcePort`, and the HTTP adapter can call Core's declared
`PortfolioStateSnapshot:v1`, `HoldingsAsOf:v1`,
`PortfolioCashMovementSummary:v1`, and `PortfolioCashflowProjection:v1` routes.

The adapter is intentionally conservative. It consumes a Core source-reported
cash-weight value when present, but it does not reconstruct that value from
cash totals, invested market value, or portfolio totals. Until Core publishes
that field and live proof is captured, source-backed high-cash evaluation can
only return blocked or caller-supplied foundation posture.
The upstream Core source-contract dependency is tracked in
`sgajbi/lotus-core#430`.

## Conversion Boundaries

RFC-0002 Slice 12 now has an internal governed conversion foundation. It maps
conversion targets to downstream source authorities:

1. `advise_proposal` outcomes must come from `lotus-advise`,
2. `manage_review` outcomes must come from `lotus-manage`,
3. `report_evidence` outcomes must come from `lotus-report`.

The current implementation records intent and outcome posture only. It does not
call downstream services, create proposals, create manage actions, create report
evidence packs, render documents, archive material, or grant suitability,
execution, compliance, mandate, or client-communication authority.
