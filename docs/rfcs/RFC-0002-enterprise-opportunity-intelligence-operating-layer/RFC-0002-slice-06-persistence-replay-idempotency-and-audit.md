# RFC-0002 Slice 06: Persistence, Replay, Idempotency, And Audit

Status: Planned

## Outcome

Persist candidate and evidence state with replayable, hash-backed, audit-ready
behavior.

## Required Work

1. Add persistence for candidate, evidence packet, lifecycle history, review
   state, feedback, suppression, conversion state, and audit events.
2. Add idempotency for signal ingestion, candidate creation, review decisions,
   AI explanation requests, and conversion intents.
3. Add replay or rebuild behavior with evidence hashes and source refs.
4. Add migration and rollback posture where persistence is introduced.

## Acceptance Gate

1. Duplicate requests do not create duplicate candidates.
2. Replay returns matching evidence hash or a clear stale-source posture.
3. Every mutating action writes an audit event.
4. Persistence tests cover conflict, replay, expiry, and recovery cases.
